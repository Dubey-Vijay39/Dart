// Here is the examples
void main(){
  print("This is string");
  print(4+3);
  var name = "Vijay";

  print(age);
}
// var keyword in Dart is used for declaring the value as everything is object in dart 
// dart assumes the data type by checking the right end value of right side item

// Note: All data types in dart are object therefore there default value is Null
